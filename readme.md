# Wether Weather
Wether Weather is an application that allows the user to view the observed (in the past 30 days) or forecasted (in the future) daily weather conditions for a given location using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs).

### Architecture

* Backend
Backend is running on a serverless application using the bref library that runs on top of the nodejs serverless library. I opted on choosing this because I am using RESTful api's for my frontend to consume. Thus a need for CORS handling to reject any requests not whitelisted on the allowed origins this allows us to use Web applications within browsers when domains aren't the same. I used the Dark sky Laravel wrapper to use its API and the Guzzle library to send concurrenct requests to time machine endpoint of the Dark sky api.

* Frontend
It is built with Vuejs with a css template I got from [w3schools](https://w3layouts.com/weather-report-widget-flat-responsive-widget-template/). This end is consuming these endpoints. Postman Collection link to be imported is [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/0fe8a20d2114fb9c9e93).

| Method        | Endpoint           | Description  |
| ------------- |:------------------:| ------------:|
| GET           | /forecasts         | Show weather forecasts for the week |
| GET           | /time-machine/forecasts      | Show 30 Day weather forecast back track  |
